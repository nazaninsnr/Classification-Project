# Mental Health Disorder Prediction

In this project, we developed an AI model capable of predicting mental health conditions based on individuals' self-written statements. By combining advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with machine learning algorithms, we trained two models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Naive Bayes.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to analyze text data from individuals' descriptions of their mental state and classify it into various mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and others. After training both models, we found that BERT significantly outperformed Naive Bayes, achieving higher accuracy in predicting the correct mental health conditions.

## Methodology

The process involved the following steps:

- **Preprocessing** the textual data.
- **Tokenizing** the data for the BERT model.
- **Training** a Naive Bayes model using TF-IDF features.
- **Deploying** the models in a web application using Flask.

## Key Achievements

- Built and trained both BERT and Naive Bayes models for mental health prediction.
- Achieved better prediction accuracy with the BERT model.
- Developed an interactive web application using Flask to deploy the models.
